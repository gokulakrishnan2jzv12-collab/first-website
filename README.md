# 📝 To-Do List Website

This is my personal **To-Do List web app** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps me stay productive by organizing my daily tasks ✅

### ✨ Features:
- Add up to 20 tasks  
- Strike out tasks when completed  
- Delete tasks (with confirmation)  
- Lock tasks so no more edits can be made  
- Saves tasks even after closing the browser  
- Cute ruled page + emoji style background 🎨
